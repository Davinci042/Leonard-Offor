I am a mid-career professional with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. I am a passionate cybersecurity professional with 2 yearsâ€™ experience as an Information security analyst seeking to contribute to join a world class security operations center team. Equipped with skill for triaging events and monitoring systems using tools to detect real threats, and actively defended small hybrid networks from cyber threats by applying the knowledge, skills and aptitude gained from my undertaking of several trainings and certifications from COMPTIA, ISC2 and Microsoft to solidify my understanding of cybersecurity principles and frameworks, such as ISO 27001, NIST CSF. I am committed to continuous learning and eager to apply my skills to protect organizations from cyber threats and ensure compliance with industry regulations.
